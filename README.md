# Advent Of Code 2020 in Swift‚ú®üöÄ   
 
## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each year an advent calendar of small programming puzzles is unlocked once a day, they can be solved in any programming language you like. 


## Preparing the environment

Last year I did the challenges in the Xcode Swift playgrounds.  
I did encounter some problems though. Playgrounds are much slower in executing the code on their main page, because they are doing quite a few checks in the background and while it is fun to use them for try out some code, they do not offer the true Swift speed.  
This year I wanna try something different with the Swift package manager. This allows me to have an executable package and to pack all my files in it.
