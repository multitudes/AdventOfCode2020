# AdventOfCode2020
 Advent Of Code 2020 in Swift

## Preparation of the environment

Last year I did the challenges in the Xcode Swift playgrounds.  
I did encounter some problems though. Playgrounds are much slower in executing the code on their main page, because they are doing quite a few checks in the background and while it is fun to use them for try out some code, they do not offer the true Swift speed.  
This year I wanna try something different with the Swift package manager. This allows me to have an executable package and to pack all my files in it.  
Also I could eventually make a library with the most used functions and import it separately.  
Sounds like something new and exciting for me, so I can learn more about packages as well!  

The way to do it is to create a new directory, call it like `AdventOfCode2020` and `cd` to it:  
```bash
cd /Volumes/iOS/AdventOfCode2020
```
Next you need to init the package:  

```bash
swift package init --type executable
```

This will create the necessary files, your folder structure will look like this:  

```
âžœ tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Package.swift
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Sources
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ AdventOfCode2020
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ main.swift
â””â”€â”€ Tests
    â”œâ”€â”€ AdventOfCode2020Tests
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ AdventOfCode2020Tests.swift
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ XCTestManifests.swift
    â””â”€â”€ LinuxMain.swift

4 directories, 6 files
```
Now build:

```bash
swift build
```
And run!

```bash
swift run AdventOfCode2020
// Hello, world!
```
This is the output of our executable because in our package we have a `main.swift` file. This file is special, it is the only one file that is called automatically by the system and executed first. Also it allows to put commands on the top level!
this are the contents of the `main.swift` file, a famous one liner: `print("Hello, world!")`

When I do `run AdventOfCode2020` I execute the main swift file in the `AdventOfCode2020` folder (under sources).
I will create a `Day1` folder contawining another main.swift file to be executed like:

`swift run Day1`

My tree will look like this now:
```bash
âžœ tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ Package.swift
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Sources
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ AdventOfCode2020
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.swift
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Day1
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ main.swift
â””â”€â”€ Tests
    â”œâ”€â”€ AdventOfCode2020Tests
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ AdventOfCode2020Tests.swift
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ XCTestManifests.swift
    â”œâ”€â”€ Day1Tests
    â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ Day1Tests.swift
    â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ XCTestManifests.swift
    â””â”€â”€ LinuxMain.swift

6 directories, 10 files
```

And to allow this I will need to modify the Package manifest file:
```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "AdventOfCode2020",
    dependencies: [
        // Dependencies declare other packages that this package depends on.
        // .package(url: /* package url */, from: "1.0.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package. A target can define a module or a test suite.
        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package, and on products in packages this package depends on.
        .target(
            name: "AdventOfCode2020",
            dependencies: []),
        .testTarget(
            name: "AdventOfCode2020Tests",
            dependencies: ["AdventOfCode2020"]),
	.target(
		name: "Day1",
		dependencies: []),
	.testTarget(
		name: "Day1Tests",
		dependencies: ["AdventOfCode2020"]),
    ]
)


```
If I click on the package file, it opens in Xcode and there I can just easily select which target I want to run, as you see in the top left corner.

So the environment is now set up ðŸ˜€
